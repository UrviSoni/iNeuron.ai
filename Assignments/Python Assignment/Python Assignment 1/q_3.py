# Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
# Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

pi = 3.14 # Taking pi = 3.14 value or you can use (22/7)
r = 6 # Here in the question they tell diameter = 12 cm so radious = (d/2) = 6 cm
V = 4/3*pi* r**3 # Volume Formula

print("The Volume of a sphere is: ", V) # printing the volume
